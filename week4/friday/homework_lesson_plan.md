## Homework

#### Sinatra Practice

The purpose of the Sinatra Practice homework is to guide students through a very basic Sinatra application. The end result should be a single page website hosted on Heroku, where students can use as a place to practice HTML/CSS for next week.

#### After this lesson you will be able to:

1. Create a basic Sinatra application.
2. Define url's that the application will accept (routes).
3. Create individual html/erb files for each route
4. Add basic HTML/CSS to the viewable pages.
5. Start the application using the `rackup` command.
6. View the application in a web browser.
7. Create a Heroku
8. Use Heroku to deploy and host the application for the world to see.
