## Davida Marion
Davida Marion comes to the first cohort of Ada Developers Academy as a specialist in library sciences and data integrity.  Her professional experiences range from freelance writing, content management, copy editing, library archiving, and ice-cream-making wizardry.  

Davida's experiences in navigating her way through labyrinthine library stacks inspired her to consider problems of information management.  She also enjoys the detail-oriented nature of programming, and how to manipulate minute parameters and restrictions to engineer ideas and solve complex problems.  She chases the thrill of finding the optimal solution to a given problem and seeing it through to the end. 

In her free time, Davida climbs, writes, plays ultimate frisbee and fantasy football, and makes the best meatballs in Seattle.

## Sue White
Sue White is an ambitious up-and-coming programmer and a proud new Seattleite. Born and raised in rural Indiana, Sue studied biochemistry at the University of Iowa and spent several years doing academic research before she set her sights on web development. She currently speaks Python (and Russian!) but is already creating new programs in Ruby.   She still finds time for reading dense texts on finance and using her biochemistry background to concoct new vegan delicacies, but Sueâ€™s primary focus is on her new career as a programmer. She is excited to explore options and capitalize on her strengths.
