## Elizabeth Uselton

Elizabeth Uselton is a banana slug from UC Santa Cruz where she earned a BA in Theater Arts. As a mollusc, she has greatly enjoyed rainy Seattle since 2008. She enjoys Star Wars, using theatrical makeup to make people look gruesome and explaining brachiosaur cardiopulmonary systems. Computer Science has always been a peripheral part of her life as she several relatives in the field, including a grandmother with an MS in CS. However, Elizabeth’s interest in code comes from a more right-brained place. “I never wanted to choose a career because I didn’t want to close other doors and limit my options. Software development seemed like the perfect way to creatively reconcile my diverse interests.”
