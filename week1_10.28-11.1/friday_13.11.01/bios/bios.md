## Anne Kimsey
Anne Kimsey is a proto-developer and outdoor enthusiast in Seattle, WA. Anne has a degree in linguistics from Evergreen State College. She loves the idea of language as way to distill all possibilities of human thought, but thinks she may have more luck demanding such specificity of computers. Anne has a varied background in teaching English and French, but decided to be a computer programmer after teaching a Burmese refugee Python on a Raspberry Pi. In her free time you can find Anne hiking… if you can keep up! When she’s not camping and or hiking she spends time reading an old fashioned paper book. She enjoys canine companionship.

## Davida Marion
Davida Marion comes to the first cohort of Ada Developers Academy as a specialist in library sciences and data integrity.  Her professional experiences range from freelance writing, content management, copy editing, library archiving, and ice-cream-making wizardry.  

Davida's experiences in navigating her way through labyrinthine library stacks inspired her to consider problems of information management.  She also enjoys the detail-oriented nature of programming, and how to manipulate minute parameters and restrictions to engineer ideas and solve complex problems.  She chases the thrill of finding the optimal solution to a given problem and seeing it through to the end. 

In her free time, Davida climbs, writes, plays ultimate frisbee and fantasy football, and makes the best meatballs in Seattle.

## Hsing-Hui Hsu
Hsing-Hui Hsu is a student at Ada Academy and an experienced linguist in Seattle WA. 

Determined to experience life from as many perspectives as possible, she has spent time learning multiple languages, including French, Chinese, and Dutch, since the same concept can feel different being expressed in different languages. She also has a Bachelor's in music performance, and is a trained clarinetist and pianist. She has also worked as a math and ESL instructor.

Hsing-Hui's background in spoken languages, as well as her general interest in math and logic has drawn her towards programming. Computer languages break everything down to the smallest expressions, and then build them back up -- similar to her teaching style, where she had to take difficult concepts and break them apart to make them understandable to non-native English speakers.

When she's not excitedly teaching herself something new, Hsing-Hui is a fantastic ultimate frisbee player and  biker.
